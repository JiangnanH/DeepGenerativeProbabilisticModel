Report guidelines: due to Covid situation, the report of lab exercise 2 can be very short, just answer questions below (less than 1 page)

1. Why are Restricted Boltzmann Machines interesting as Energy based models?
2. When using a single Markov Chain to sample from the model, what do you observe with respect to the model space exploration?
3. In practice, what advice could you give to someone who needs many samples from the model?
