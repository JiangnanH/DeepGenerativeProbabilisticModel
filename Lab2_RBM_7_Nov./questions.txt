Report guidelines: due to Covid situation, the report of lab exercise 2 can be very short, just answer questions below (less than 1 page)

1. Why are Restricted Boltzmann Machines interesting as Energy based models?
- easy to apply Gibbs sampling.(So relatively easy to implement)

2. When using a single Markov Chain to sample from the model, what do you observe with respect to the model space exploration?
- the first sampling points are not good
- each sampling point is highly related to the previous one. Some continuous sampling points may form a "cluster".

3. In practice, what advice could you give to someone who needs many samples from the model?
- skip the first sampling points as the MC has not been converged.
- avoid taking continuous sampling points. (maybe take points with a certain interval)
- take sampling points from several different Markov Chain.
